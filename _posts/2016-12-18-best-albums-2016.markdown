**2016 was not an easy year.**

Fake news. Email scandals. Unpaid taxes. 2016 felt like a year where hiding behind the veil of falsehood paid off more than just, well, being yourself. Moreso troubling is the helpless feeling associated with confronting our world’s pressing issues.

That’s not to say I’m an idealist — I don’t expect my government to act as civil [as our neighbors to the north do](https://twitter.com/dk_munro/status/785116410796056576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). I don’t expect to be able to [ever afford a house in Seattle](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/seattle-bumps-boston-expensive-u-s-housing-market-thats-not-california/). Hell, I don’t even expect Frank Ocean to release a new records on a regular basis.

What’s important is defending our right to express ourselves freely. While the phrase “identity politics” nicks the importance of this concept, we can do better than let CNN define our vocabulary.

Where does music come into all of this? It’s one of the few mediums that accepts people of all identities. Music is agnostic whether you listen to music by yourself or attend concerts, if you prefer Loretta Lynn over ODB, or if you listen with Beats headphones or Apple earbuds.

As for freeing myself, 2016 is the year I stop lying to you. I always chose 20 albums in [my](http://buttery-toast.tumblr.com/post/70335137082/not-travelin-alone-buttery-toasts-best-lps-of) [best of](http://buttery-toast.tumblr.com/post/104602538352/best-albums-2014) [lists](https://medium.com/@justxiaohan/buttery-toast-s-best-albums-of-2015-81f8e109851e#.y9c3lty22), but to be frank, I rarely gave these albums the spins they deserved to accurately rate them. For better or for worse, I’m the type who put Lemonade on repeat for two months straight without listening to a single other album.

For 2016, I confess that I’m not a cultured purveyor of music. Instead of 20 picks, I’m honored to share with you a few of my favorites, and hopefully the quality of my list improves because of it. I hope you’ll still find something unexpected from my list of essentials of 2016.
